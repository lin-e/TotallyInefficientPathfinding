# TotallyInefficientPathfinding
Got bored and decided to work on my own interpretation of Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm. Not exactly efficient, but it works. Kinda.

Not really supposed to be shared or used by anyone (since (much) more efficient algorithms exist). But I made it and I might as well upload it here?
