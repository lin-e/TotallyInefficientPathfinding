# TotallyInefficientPathfinding
Got bored and decided to work on my own interpretation of Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm. Not exactly efficient, but it works. Kinda. This also uses my interpretation of Prim's algorithm, since the pseudo-code on Wikipedia was hard to follow, and I ended up with a very broken maze. 

Not really supposed to be shared or used by anyone (since (much) more efficient algorithms exist). But I made it and I might as well upload it here?
